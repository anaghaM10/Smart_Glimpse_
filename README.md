# Smart-Glimpse

Smart Glimpse represents a pioneering fusion of traditional mirrors with state-of-the-art technology, boasting a
sophisticated two-way interface. Utilizing two-way mirror film, display panels, and Raspberry Pi hardware, alongside HTML/CSS,
JavaScript, Node.js, and Python, it offers real-time information such as calendar events, compliments, news headlines, weather updates,
and a clock. With emotion detection capabilities and LED mood lighting, it enhances user interaction, showcasing the transformative
power of software and hardware convergence in everyday objects

Upon activation in the Raspberry Pi terminal, the system undergoes a brief initialization period lasting
approximately 15 seconds to ensure seamless functionality. Upon establishing internet connectivity, it
systematically retrieves pertinent data from diverse online sources, subsequently presenting the compiled
information on the mirror screen.This integration of real-time content amplifies user engagement and augments the mirror's utility as an
informational hub. Additionally, leveraging the camera's capabilities for emotion detection, the system
dynamically adjusts the ambient lighting to correspond with detected emotional states.Specifically, a green hue signifies happiness, red denotes anger, blue conveys sadness, and white indicates
neutrality, thereby enriching the user experience with nuanced visual feedback tailored to emotional cues.
